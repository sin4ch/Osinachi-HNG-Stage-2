## Benefits and Learnings

Completing this project as part of the HNG DevOps Stage 2 task has given me practical skills in Docker, AWS, and Nginx Proxy Manager. Itâ€™s been a fantastic learning experience that has laid a solid foundation for my future DevOps endeavors.

The repository is organized into two main directories:

Each directory has its own README file with detailed instructions specific to that part of the application.
